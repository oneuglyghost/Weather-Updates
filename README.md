# Weather-Updates


This web app was made to practice using HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as practicing using openwheatherapi.
the app made so that when you search for the name of a city it is ran through openwheatherapi and if it comes back as a valid search item it gets saved to local storage and displayed under the search button as a past searched item that can be clicked to make a call to the api where it will display the name of the city, the current date, the temperature, wind speed and humidity it will aslo show a 5 day forecast of the current city selected.
